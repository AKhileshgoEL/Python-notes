# len() : get the number of elements in a list
<span style="color:red;">This is red text.</span>
print("Length:", len(my_list))

# append() : adds an element to the end of the list
my_list.append("orange")

# insert() : adds an element at the specified position
my_list.insert(1, "blueberry")
print(my_list)

# create list with repeated elements
list_with_zeros = [0] * 5
print(list_with_zeros)

# convert string to list
string_to_list = list('Hello')
print(string_to_list)

list_org = ["banana", "cherry", "apple"]

# this just copies the reference to the list, so be careful
list_copy = list_org

# now modifying the copy also affects the original
list_copy.append(True)
print(list_copy)
print(list_org)

# use copy(), or list(x) to actually copy the list
# slicing also works: list_copy = list_org[:]
list_org = ["banana", "cherry", "apple"]

list_copy = list_org.copy()
# list_copy = list(list_org)
# list_copy = list_org[:]

# now modifying the copy does not affect the original
list_copy.append(True)
print(list_copy)
print(list_org)
