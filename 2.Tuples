Reasons to use a tuple over a list
Generally used for objects that belong together.
Use tuple for heterogeneous (different) datatypes and list for homogeneous (similar) datatypes.
Since tuple are immutable, iterating through tuple is slightly faster than with list.
Tuples with their immutable elements can be used as key for a dictionary. This is not possible with lists.
If you have data that doesn't change, implementing it as tuple will guarantee that it remains write-protected.
